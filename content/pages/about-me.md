Machine learning engineer and software developer.

I've also worked as data scientist on academic and professional projects.

I've worked on products that have scaled to several million users and hundreds of millions of processed datapoints.

I currently work at [Indix.com](http://www.indix.com), where I work with machine learning algorithms on product data.
